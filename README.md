# Stock Price Prediction

## Stock Price Prediction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
This project explores the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and machine learning to predict stock prices.

### Project Goals
1. Develop a model to predict stock prices based on historical data.
2. Utilize PCA to reduce dimensionality and potentially improve model performance.
3. Evaluate the model's accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### Key Concepts
1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
2. Data cleaning techniques are employed to ensure data quality. This includes:
- Converting categorical data (likely dates) into numerical formats (e.g., timestamps).
- Transforming data types (e.g., converting "object" columns to numerical types).

2. Feature Engineering:
The data is transformed into a format suitable for machine learning models. This involves:
- Converting the DataFrame into vectors and then into a matrix.
- Applying PCA to reduce the number of features and potentially improve model performance.

3. Machine Learning Analysis:
- The data is split into training and testing sets.
- A machine learning model is trained to predict stock prices.
- The model's performance is evaluated on the unseen testing data using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### Skills Demonstrated
1. Data Manipulation: Utilizing pandas libraries to handle and transform data.
2. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: Implementing PCA to reduce complexity and identify the most significant features for prediction.
3. Machine Learning Model Building: Constructing and evaluating a machine learning model for stock price prediction.
4. Vectors and Matrices: Working with data represented as matrices.
5. Data Analysis and Interpretation: Analyzing the principal components to understand relationships between stocks.
